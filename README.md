# Experiment 5: Simulation of Single Server Queue (M/M/1 Model) 

**Question:**

Write a Python program to simulate a single server queueing system (M/M/1) 
with infinite capacity, where customers arrive randomly at a service counter (e.g., a bank or 
ticket counter). 

**AIM:**

To implement and simulate a single server infinite capacity queue (M/M/1) using Python 
and study customer waiting time, service time, and system utilization.  

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:** Python and numpy library
